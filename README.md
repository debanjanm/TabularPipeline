## TabularPipeline
## Overview
TabularPipeline is a robust and efficient pipeline designed for handling tabular data. It streamlines the processes of data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation, making it ideal for data science projects involving structured datasets.
## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Model training
- Model evaluation
- Saving and loading models


## Installation

Install my-project with npm

```bash
pip install tabularpipeline
```
    
## Usage/Examples

```python
from tabularpipeline import TabularPipeline

# Initialize the pipeline
pipeline = TabularPipeline(config_path='config.yaml')

# Load data
pipeline.load_data('data/raw/dataset.csv')

# Preprocess data
pipeline.preprocess()

# Feature engineering
pipeline.feature_engineering()

# Train model
pipeline.train_model()

# Evaluate model
pipeline.evaluate_model()

# Save the model
pipeline.save_model('models/trained_model.pkl')
```


## Configuration
Refer to the `config.yaml` file for customizing preprocessing steps, feature engineering techniques, and model parameters.
